# DSAP (Digital Signal Analysis and Processing) Lab

## Project Overview

This project is part of the DSAP lab, where four lab experiments were conducted to explore various aspects of digital signal processing using MATLAB. Each lab focuses on a different objective, ranging from familiarizing with basic plotting techniques to analyzing discrete-time signals and performing signal operations like convolution, autocorrelation, and Fourier transforms.

## Lab Objectives

### Lab 1: MATLAB Plotting Techniques
- **Objective**: To familiarize with MATLAB's plotting techniques using `plot()` and `stem()` functions.
- **Files**:
  - `lab1/lab1.m`: MATLAB script for Lab 1.
  - `lab1/lab1.jpg`: Plot generated from Lab 1.

### Lab 2: Discrete-Time Signal Characteristics
- **Objective**: To plot and gain valuable insight into the characteristics of various discrete-time signals.
- **Files**:
  - `lab2/lab2.m`: MATLAB script for Lab 2.
  - `lab2/lab2.jpg`: Plot generated from Lab 2.

### Lab 3: Convolution and Autocorrelation
- **Objective**: To compute and plot the convolution and autocorrelation of signals.
- **Files**:
  - `lab3/lab3.m`: MATLAB script for Lab 3.
  - `lab3/lab3.jpg`: Plot generated from Lab 3.

### Lab 4: Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
- **Objective**: To implement the DFT algorithm and analyze the transformation of a sinewave from the time domain to the frequency domain and back.
- **Files**:
  - `lab4/lab4.m`: MATLAB script for Lab 4.
  - `lab4/lab4.jpg`: Plot generated from Lab 4.
